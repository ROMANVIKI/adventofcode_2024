Advent of Code 2024

This repository will track my progress throughout the 2024 Advent of Code challenge. I'll be solving each day's problem and pushing the solutions as I go. My goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, learn new algorithms and data structures, and sharpen my coding abilities in general.

Each solution will be well-documented with explanations and thought processes, so you can follow along and understand the approach for each problem. I’ll be using a variety of programming languages and techniques, exploring different problem-solving strategies along the way.

Feel free to contribute, discuss, or provide feedback on any of the solutions. Let’s see how far we can go together!
